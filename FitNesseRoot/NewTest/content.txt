This is a suite of tests. All of the tests share the same SetUp and TearDown. The SetUp instantiates a module in the default container in a server. The TearDown stops that server. Servers are re-used if they are using the same module -- this is important! So multiple tests against the same module work fast.

Common setup (configuration etc) can be done in the SetUp as well.

Enqueue and Dequeue Fixtures are demonstrated.
